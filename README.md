Also see the project code in the following branches:

* [android-btle](https://github.com/ndncomm/ndn-btle/tree/android-btle): The Android consumer to send an interest over BTLE.
* [arduino](https://github.com/ndncomm/ndn-btle/tree/arduino): The Arduino producer to send a data packet over BTLE.
* [android](https://github.com/ndncomm/ndn-btle/tree/android): A temporary development branch to begin the BTLeForwarder class. This was merged into the android-btle branch.
